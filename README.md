## Introduction
SketchEase is a digital drawing app, tailored for beginner artists. It focuses on simplifying the digital art process by providing an intuitive, user-centric interface and essential tools that cater to the needs of casual digital artists.

## Hierarchical Task Analysis
Our approach involved a detailed analysis of the task "Draw and color a cartoon character." We observed variations in tool selections, particularly in color application methods. This analysis helped us understand user preferences in tool selection, shape creation, color application, and navigation within the app.

## Interview Protocol & Recruiting
We conducted interviews with individuals experienced in casual digital art. Our recruitment focused on personal networks, leveraging online platforms like social media and messaging apps.

### Recruiting Message
We invited participants with this message:

"Hello! My name is [__], a student at UC Berkeley studying User Interface Design and Development. I'm researching digital drawing tools usage and experience, aiming to understand how casual digital artists interact with these platforms. The study involves a 20-minute interview about your digital drawing experiences, preferences, and challenges. Your insights will aid in developing SketchEase, a new, user-friendly drawing app. If interested, please respond to this message. Thank you, [__]"

## Interview Guide
We used six key questions to explore users' activities, attitudes, skills, and motivations in digital drawing, with emphasis on certain high-value questions.

## Observational Task
In addition to interviews, we incorporated an observational task where users drew and colored simple objects and a cartoon character using their preferred tools.

## Findings from the Interview
Key insights included:
1. Participants varied from beginner to mid-level, mostly using tablets spontaneously.
2. Challenges were noted in brush selection and navigation, especially in Procreate.
3. Users expressed confusion in color selection and a desire for default palettes.
4. High use of basic tools like default brushes, erasers, and undo buttons was observed.
5. A need for multiple layers for comfortable coloring and erasing was identified.

## Design Concept & Sketches
SketchEase aims to be beginner-friendly, addressing challenges faced on platforms like Procreate. Features include default palettes, simple color selection, essential brushes, and an interface optimized for tablet users.

### Figma Prototype
We developed responsive prototypes for both tablet and phone versions.

### Interactive Prototype
Our interactive prototype, built on the Figma design, includes slidable brush size, transparency, and color sliders. It demonstrates the HSL color selection, a feature not available in Figma.

## Reflection
Our interactive prototype successfully addresses user pain points identified in our research. While some functionalities like canvas drawing and settings overlay were not implemented due to time constraints, our focus remained on alleviating the primary challenges faced by users.
